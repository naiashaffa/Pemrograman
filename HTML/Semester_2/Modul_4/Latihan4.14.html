        Well the faster that you come
        <br />The sooner that you leave
        <br />I must be going down
        <br />'Cause I can hardly breathe

    <div id="round">
        I wish I was your joke
        <br />Passed around in sordid bars
        <br />When you can't drive your car anymore
        <br />You'll keep me in your back pocket
        <br />Use me then you'll ignore it
        <br />I don't mind
