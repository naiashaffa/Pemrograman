        Start to talk and then your diction slips
        <br />Miss the punchline, you could use a script
        <br />You're laughing at yourself and so is everybody else
        <br />Left in this place
    </p>

    <p>
        Well the faster that you come
        <br />The sooner that you leave
        <br />I must be going down
        <br />'Cause I can hardly breathe
    </p>

    <p>
        <br />I wish I was your joke
        <br />Passed around in sordid bars
        <br />When you can't drive your car anymore
        <br />You'll keep me in your back pocket
        <br />Use me then you'll ignore it
        <br />I don't mind
    </p>
